# GSVPano.js - Google Street View Panorama lib

Library to help requesting and stitching Google Street View panoramas. 

#### Where is it then? ####

Sadly, I've been requested by the Maps team to remove the library, since it was enabling people to break Google's Terms of Service. Which is true, but also an intrinsic problem with the only purpose of the library. Let's hope in a very near future the Google Maps API will provide a very similar feature.
